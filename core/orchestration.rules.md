# Orchestration Rules

1. Read repository context first (docs + code).
2. Select skills by trigger keywords.
3. Apply mandatory rules BEFORE writing code.
4. Prefer minimal, incremental changes.
5. Never violate: security, privacy, reliability, testing standards.
6. Always produce an actionable output:
   - summary
   - files touched
   - risks
   - next step
